* Stuff to implement
** widget rendering and views
** history
   Figure out how widgets will maintain state history so that the back button will work - maybe this can be done using object deltas which record the differences between interactions
** before-render
   Figure out if all before-renders happen before rendering starts
** def-page
   Can define a page with an associated url
* 5/10/2011 - look at initform again in defwidget macro
* 5/15/2011 - look at continuations
* 5/17/2011 - look at forms - inputs evaluated before submit - need to test this code
* 5/20/2011 - come up with a higher level way of doing form input setting - lik 'on:of' in seaside
* 5/21/2011 - form dropdown menus - need to allow for pre-selecting an input and allowing object values to display themselves
