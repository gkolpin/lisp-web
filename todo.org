* Stuff to implement
** widget rendering and views
** history
   Figure out how widgets will maintain state history so that the back button will work - maybe this can be done using object deltas which record the differences between interactions
** before-render
   Figure out if all before-renders happen before rendering starts
** def-page
   Can define a page with an associated url
* 5/10/2011 - look at initform again in defwidget macro
* 5/15/2011 - look at continuations
* 5/17/2011 - look at forms - inputs evaluated before submit - need to test this code
* 5/20/2011 - come up with a higher level way of doing form input setting - lik 'on:of' in seaside
* 5/21/2011 - form dropdown menus - need to allow for pre-selecting an input and allowing object values to display themselves
* 5/22/2011 - Look at removing submit-specific stuff from create-basic-input
* 5/25/2011 -
  Fix up with-callback to remove code duplication and add in calls to the callback required hash,
  and look at single-threaded taskmaster and debugging (it doesn't appear to be working when *debug*
  should be true
* 5/27/2011
  -checkbox callback is getting called even when the increment link is clicked. We need to keep callbacks for a form grouped together, so that the callbacks
  for the form only get called when the form is submitted
* 5/28/2011
  -redo the create-form macro so that links can be placed in forms without their callbacks being placed in the forms *callback-hash*
  -redo radio-group macro so that it resembles the create-form macro
* 5/29/2011
  - finish 'with' param for date-input
  - finish 'options' param for date-input
* 5/31/2011
  - fix :initform args for defwidget
* 6/23/2011
  - fix html-to-string (it's trying to be a code walker, but it fails miserably for things like (let ((<name-of-who-fun>))...))
* 6/24/2011
  - create form file upload utility
  - determine what 'calling' a widget means for things like the children method - when is the children method used and does the callee's children method get called instead of the caller's?
  - look at being able to 'call' functions and place them in render-stacks
  - test on-true and on-false for checkbox
  - remove 'slot-value' usages - because of historied widgets, all slot access needs to be through methods, not slot-value
